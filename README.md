 3. double shortestPathDist(int src, int dest);
 4. List<node_data> shortestPath(int src, int dest);
 5. Save(file); // JSON file
 6. Load(file); // JSON file

__public directed_weighted_graph copy():__</p>
This method creats a new identical graph to the current graph.
creates a new graph, and builds new nodes identical to the nodes from the old graph,
 connects any two adjacent nodes from the old graph and returns the new graph

__public boolean isConnected():__</p>
This mehod returns true if and only if this graph is strongly connected.
This function starts from a random node on the graph and goes through all its neighbors to see if there is a way from it to all the nodes in the graph.
 after that, the function changes the direction of all the edges of the graph and checks whether it is still possible to reach all thenode of the graph from this vertex 
if we failed to perform one of the steps the function will return false.

__public double shortestPathDist(int src, int dest):__</p>
This method calculates the shortest path between two given nodes in a directed weighted graph
We used a Dijkstra's algorithm, we initialized the values of all nodes to be -1.
We started with the node src and from there moved on to all its neighbors so that the weight of each node is updated to the value of the previous node and the edge beteen them weight .
Thus for each node we chose the neighbor with the lowest value until we went through all the nodes of the graph.
The weight value of the dest is the minimum distance between the two nodes.

__public directed_weighted_graph switchGraph():__</p>
Auxiliary function to shortestPath and isconnected methods, creats a new directed weighted graph with opposite direction for each edge.
returns the new graph.

__public List<node_data> shortestPath(int src, int dest):__</p>
this method returns a  list of all the nodes in the shortest path between the two given nodes.
this method first uses shortestPathDist method to calculate the minimum distance between the two given nodes
then we go to the dest node and uses switchGraph to change the direction of each edge in the graph and then goes back to the src node. we added each node at the rode to the list.
returns the list.

__public List<List<node_data>> searchComponents()__</p>
This function finds all the Components connectivity in a graph and builds a list of lists of NodeData  where each list represents a Components connectivity  in the graph. 
The function goes over each node in the graph and calls the auxiliary function searchComponent
And this function returns the Components connectivity
If the node already belongs to another Components connectivity the function does not call the auxiliary function.

__private List<node_data> searchComponent(node_data node):__</p>
This function receives a single node and checks Components connectivity by checking which node it reaches in the graph then it turnsdirection of each edge in the graph using switchGraph method,
 and checks again to which nodes it can get. then makes cutting between these two groups of nodes and returns a list Of the cut

This method saves this weighted graph to the given file name

__public boolean load2(String file)__</p>
This method load a graph to this graph algorithm from the given json string.

__public boolean load(String file):__</p>
This method load a graph to this graph algorithm from the given file name.
